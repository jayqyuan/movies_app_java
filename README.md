# 🎬 Movie Backend API

Welcome to the **backend** of our movie application! This repo focuses on the server-side implementation that powers the movie management and review system. The backend is built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **MongoDB**, and **Maven** to ensure seamless interaction between the application and the database.

If you're looking for the frontend, which includes an interactive UI with React, Axios, Material-UI, and more, feel free to check it out [here](https://github.com/jayqyuan/movie_app_client).

- 📂 **Movie Management**: Retrieve a list of movies and their details, including titles, posters, and trailers.
- 📝 **Review System**: Allows users to add reviews to movies, making the app interactive and dynamic.
- 💾 **MongoDB Integration**: Data is stored and retrieved efficiently using MongoDB as the database solution.
- 🛠️ **Spring Boot**: A robust framework that simplifies backend development and API creation.
